# Satellite1 XMOS firmware

## Variants
**satellite1_firmware_fixed_delay**

Uses the 'Automatic Delay Estimation and Correction' pipeline of the sln_voice example repository.

**satellite1_firmware_bypass**

A variant which bypasses the mic-pipeline. Hence, the raw mic signal is streamed to the ESP32-S3.

**explorer1_firmware_{fixed_delay|bypass}**

Firmware for debugging purposes only. It runs on the  XCORE.AI evaluation board. 

**satellite1_usb_debug**

Firmware for debugging purposes only. It enables basic logging on the satellite1 via usb-cdc. 

## Firmware Files

**variant_name.factory.bin**

A complete image of the flash memory, including both the boot partition (containing the flash loader and factory image) and the data partition.

**variant_name.upgrade.bin**

A firmware upgrade image that can be uploaded through the Device Firmware Update (DFU) service. Requires a factory image with DFU support running on the device.


**variant_name.xe**

The XMOS executable (XE) binary format stores programs for XMOS devices and includes information about the system it is intended to run on, allowing support for multiple program loads, configurations and debugging.


## Flashing via Satellite1 ESPHome Firmware


## Flashing via dfu-util
> **Note:** The Satellite1 does not come with a pre-flashed XMOS firmware. Hence, the initial firmware needs to be written directly to the flash memory via SPI. Use 'Flashing via Satellite1 ESPHome Firmware' in this case.  


If the XMOS device is running a factory firmware with DFU over USB support, an upgrade image can be uploaded as follows:
```bash
dfu-util -e -a 1 -D variant_name.upgrade.bin
```


## Running / Flashing via xTAG
> **Note**: The Satellite1 does not include an xTAG debugger. This option applies only when testing the firmware with a developer board like the XCORE.AI EVALUATION KIT. 

When the XMOS board is connected as a USB xTag device, the firmware can be run or flashed as follows:

Running without flashing:

```bash
xrun --xscope variant_name.xe
```

Flashing:
```bash
xflash --quad-spi-clock 50MHz --factory variant_name.xe --boot-partition-size 0x100000 --data variant_name_data_partition.bin
```


## Building the firmware locally

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FutureProofHomes/Satellite1-XMOS.git
cd Satellite1-XMOS
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Creating factory and upgrade images

On Linux and Mac run:

```bash
cmake -B build --toolchain xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
cd build

make create_flash_img_variant_name
make create_upgrade_img_variant_name
```

On Windows run:
```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build --toolchain xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
cd build

ninja create_flash_img_variant_name
ninja create_upgrade_img_variant_name
```

### Building the XMOS executable only (.xe file)
Run the following commands in the root folder to build the firmware.

On Linux and Mac run:

```bash
cmake -B build --toolchain xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
cd build

make variant_name
```

On Windows run:
```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build --toolchain xmos_cmake_toolchain/xs3a.cmake
cd build

ninja variant_name
```
