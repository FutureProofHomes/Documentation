    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/remove_tab.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Remove the speaker hole tab with a pair of pliers.

-   :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Apply Sealing Foam__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/apply_sealing_foam.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Adhere the sealing foam around the parameter of the front enclosure piece, tweeter and woofer.  Cut any excess foam with scissors and keep for later.
    

-   :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Install Speaker Drivers__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/install_speaker_drivers_edited.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    1. Use four (4) M3x10mm hex screws to install the tweeter with the terminals facing north and south.

    2. Use another four (4) M3x10mm hex screws to install the woofer with both speaker terminals facing north.

-   :material-numeric-4-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Prepare Crossover Wiring__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/crossover_wiring.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    1. Orient the crossover so no blue terminal faces south. 

    2. Use a small phillips head screwdriver to connect the supplied JST-XH cable to the east-facing terminal. 
    3. On the north and west terminals, secure the 5.3 mm red wires to positive (+) and the 2.8 mm black wires to negative (–). 
    4. Optionally use the supplied jumpers to boost bass and/or treble.

-   :material-numeric-5-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Install Crossover & Connect Speakers__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/crossover_speaker_cables_edited.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    1. Use two (2) M3x10mm hex screws to securely mount the crossover to the front piece.  Connect cables to speakers.  

    2. We recommend applying sealing foam around the JST-XH cable to ensure an airtight seal at the speaker hole.

-   :material-numeric-6-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Insert Screws__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/all_screws_with_screw_guide_edited.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Insert seven (7) M3x10mm hex screws into the front chamber, use the screw guide tool to not drive them in too far. Do not add a screw at the bottom.
    

-   :material-numeric-7-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Mount Back Chamber__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/mount_back_chamber.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Align the two chamber parts together, making sure the JST wire is not pinched and that the foam forms an airtight seal. Slide the parts together with the front piece moving downward and the back piece moving upward.


-   :material-numeric-8-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Fasten All Screws__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/add_bottom_screw.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Drop the bottom screw into place and use the hex wrench to loosely fasten.

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/fasten_all_screws.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Evenly tighten all the screws in an alternating pattern until you feel resistance (approx 4-5 turns), be careful to not overtighten the screws.

-   :material-numeric-9-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Mount the PCB Dev Kit__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/connect_JST_cable_3.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/mounted_dev_kit.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    1. Press the Core and Hat PCBs firmly together ([see details here](satellite1-assembly.md)) and connect the JST-XH cable.
    
    2. Rest the Sat1 on the enclosure's four mounting posts while ensuring the headphone jack is facing the rear. Hand-tighten four (4) hex screws to secure the PCBs to the enclosure.
    

-   :material-numeric-10-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Assemble Top Piece & LED Diffuser__

    ---

    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/push_in_diffuser.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    ![Image title](/assets/smart-speaker-enclosure-kit/mount_top_piece.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    1. Snap the LED diffuser into the top piece.

    2. Lightly push the top piece assembly down on the enclsoures 4 ball joints making sure the headphone jack opening is facing the rear.

!!! info "Parts not sold seperately outside of kit"

    Due to supply chain complexities, we do not sell the enclosure, drivers, or other components separately if you choose to print the enclosure yourself.

!!! info "Finding Compatible Speakers"

    The Satellite1 Smart Speaker Enclosure Kit uses high-quality drivers from LG.  If purchasing from online suppliers please watch out for counterfits and clones.  Because of this problem we don't have reliable links to purchase the exact drivers.  Please feel free to modify the enclsoure to fit your preferred speakers.  Enjoy!
