## First Boot - Unboxing Experience
The below instructions assume you have connected the HAT to the CORE and are powering the Satellite1 for the first time:

1. Take a USB-C cable and plug one end into the USB socket on the Hat labeled "CORE/ESP".
2. Plug the other end into a [9V USB-C power supply](satellite1-recommended-accessories.md#power-supply) (if you want to power a speaker from the HAT), or a computer 5V USB-C connection (if you're plugging into the headphone jack).
3. Upon first boot, you will see the blue LEDs count down clockwise as the device flashes the XMOS audio processor chip.
4. Finally, the LEDs will begin to sparkle a warm white color. Congrats! Move to the next step.
