## PoE1 Module (Coming Soon...)

If you're familiar with the Satellite1 Dev Kit, you know it consists of two PCB boards: the "CORE" and the "HAT." The HAT includes an expansion port, which will allow you to connect our upcoming "PoE SHOE" module.

The PoE SHOE Module will unlock the following features:

- Provides Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) to the Satellite1 that will power on the product and supply wired networking.
- Allows to relocate the mmWave inside the speaker chamber and position it any angle towards the room.
- Allows to relocate the temperature/humidity sensor inside the speaker chamber.
- Includes a QWIIC connector to support tons of external sensors from Sparkfun
