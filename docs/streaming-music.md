The good news is there's a giant 25 Watt amplifier built into Satellite1 and if you have a good speaker or headphones (and the appropriate [power supply](./recommended-accessories.md/) you'll be able to stream high-quality music to it with music assistant from Home Assistant.  Follow this excellent guide to get Music Assistant (MA) installed and configured to stream to your Satellite1.

!!! tip "A Couple Tips:"

    1. Spotify ONLY works if you are a paying subscriber.  Free accounts will not work.  This may or may not be addressed in future versions of MA.
    2. Watch your volume!  25 watts of power can be LOUD!
