## Using Music Assistant to stream music to your Satellite1!

Your new Satellite1 can control your home now but what about streaming music? The good news is there's a giant 25 Watt amplifier built into satellite one and if you have a good speaker or headphones (and the appropriate [power supply](Accessories.md)) you'll be able to stream high-quality music to it with music assistant from Home Assistant.  Follow this excellent guide to get Music Assistant (MA) installed and configured to stream to your Satellite1.

A couple of tips:
    - Spotify ONLY works if you are a paying subscriber.  Free accounts will not work.  This is a limitation of MA, and may or may not be addressed in future versions.
    - Watch your volume!  25 watts of power can be LOUD!
