## Add Sat1 via Snapcast Protocol

If you have multiple Satellite1 devices, you can use our Snapcast implementation to stream synchronized multi-room music or even pair two Sat1 speakers together for true left/right stereo sound.

!!! INFO "Software Requirements"
    - Sat1 must be running firmware v1.0.3 or higher.
    - Home Assistant should be running 2025.7.x or higher.
    - Music Assistant should be running 2.5.7 or higher.
  
!!! INFO "Network Requirements"
    - Ports 1704 & 1705 must be open for the Snapserver to communicate with the Sat1 Snapclient.
    - Ports 4953 through 5153 must be open per [Music Assistant's Snapcast requirements](https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/snapcast/).
    - mDNS is recommended for the Snapserver to autodetect the Sat1 Snapclient.

## Snapcast Multi-Speaker Stereo Playback & Static Grouping

This feature lets you semi-permanently group Sat1 speakers, such as combining all your upstairs speakers into one group or pairing two Sat1 speakers for stereo sound.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Create a Group Player__

    ---

    ![Create a Group](/assets/MA_snapcast_speakers.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Go to MA **"Settings -> :material-speaker: icon"** and select **"Add Group Player"**.

-   :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Name the Stereo Pair Group__

    ---

    ![Name the Stereo Pair](/assets/MA_stereo_pair.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Select **"Snapcast Group Type"**. Keep **"Dynamic Group"** off. Give the group a name and add the two Sat1 speakers you want in the stereo pair.

-   :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Set Channel Output__

    ---

    ![Set speaker to correct channel](/assets/HA_channel_selection.png){ loading=lazy }  
    In Home Assistant, navigate to **"Settings -> Devices & Services -> ESPHome"** and set the correct **"Speaker Channel Output"** for each speaker.

    !!! Info "Tips:"
        - Channel selection only relates to the built-in speaker and not audio coming out of the headphone jack.
        - If Music Assistant's volume control is not controlling all speakers in the group, then restart things.

## Controlling Music with Your Voice

!!! Warning "Beta Feature Zone!"

    These capabilities are still rough around the edges. Please be patient. :)

Not only do we want to say, *"Hey Jarvis, turn down the volume"* or *"Hey Jarvis, play the next song"*, but we also want to say, *“Hey Jarvis, play the Beatles,”* and have it play on that speaker (or at least ask which speaker to use). Currently, this is hard to do, but not impossible.

To achieve all this, I highly recommend reading [Music Assistant’s Voice Support Repository](https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support). However, I have personally found these implementations to be cumbersome and unreliable and instead have been using a different solution I'll share here (although it does currently require cloud AI).

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Cloud AI Conversation Agent__

    ---

    ![Cloud AI Pipeline](/assets/MA_google_ai_pipline.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Use a voice pipeline with a Cloud AI conversation agent. Tick on **"Prefer handling commands locally"** to get the best results.

-   :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Edit Speaker Device__

    ---

    ![Edit MA Speakers in HA](/assets/MA_integration_speaker_naming.png){ loading=lazy }  
    In Home Assistant, navigate to **"Settings -> Devices & Services -> Music Assistant"** and open the context menu to **"Edit Device"** for each speaker.

-   :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Good Naming Conventions__

    ---

    ![Name Device](/assets/MA_name_device.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Give the device an intuitive name. Be sure to assign an area. Click **Update**.

-   :material-numeric-4-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Entity Settings__

    ---

    ![Name Device](/assets/MA_expose_speaker.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Click on the newly renamed device to see all its entities. Then click on the actual media player entity in the controls section. Click the **settings :gear: icon**.

-   :material-numeric-5-circle:{ .lg .middle } __Expose Speaker to Assist__

    ---

    ![Name Device](/assets/MA_voice_assistant.png){ loading=lazy }  
    Click on **"Voice assistants"** and toggle on **"Assist"** to expose the Music Assistant speaker to your voice assistant.

</div>

!!! Info "My Results:"
    - Playing a song by **artist** or **track name** works fairly well.  
    - If you don’t specify a speaker, it *sometimes* chooses the right one automatically; therefore it is best to **explicitly specify which speaker** you want to control.  
    - You **can’t control multiple speakers** in an area (yet).  
    - You **can’t group or ungroup Snapcast speakers** (yet).
