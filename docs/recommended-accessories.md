## Powering your Satellite 1 board
Specifications: 

!!! note
    Power Requirements- The complete assembly requires up to 30W of power at maximum consumption, when using a 20-25W speaker. We recommend at least a 30W power supply, that can deliver 20V @ 1.5A or greater

You can power your Satellite board using several methods.  Each one has it's pros and cons.
  1) Power it by plugging it into your computer.  This is easy & great way to get started. The headphone jack on the Sat1 will still work. Disadvantages:
       - The external speaker will not work.  There isn't enough power to power the audio amplifier using this method.
  2) Power it using a phone charger
     - This may or may not work.  Phone chargers that have less than 3A will likely not work.
  3) Power it with a Hi-Power USB brick.
     - This is really the way to go.  You get to use the internal 25w amplifier for an external speaker.
       The big Apple computer chargers will work.  This is the charger we recommend - its a 30watt USB wall power adapter

## Speaker and connectors
The Satellite 1 comes with all kinds of options you might wish to enable.  One of the most useful is an external speaker.  NOTE: to usse the external speaker, yYou MUST use a power supply with sufficient Voltage and Current.  Most USB phone chargers do not supply sufficient power for the Satllite1's amplifier to work. See above for specifications.

There is a 2 pin JST 2.5mm female connector on the Hat board labeled SPKR OUT. Connect a speaker to this jack using these JST type connectors

Once you get a speaker and the JST connectors, solder one to your speaker. The smaller tab is (-) and goes to the BLACK  wire, and the bigger tab is (+)and goes to the RED wire.  Then plug it into you Sat1 like this:

For testing purposes, we've found that the plastic spray paint can tops are the perfect size to drop the speaker into!  It protects it and gives it much better bass response.
