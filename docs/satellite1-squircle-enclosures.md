## Overview
The "Squircle Enclosure Family" for the Satellite1 Dev Kit includes three optional speaker chamber sizes—small (1-inch), medium (2.5-inch), and large (3-inch)—with the top components of the design remaining identical across all sizes. The entire enclosure is designed to be assembled using M3 x 8mm screws.

## Understanding the Design

The "Top Plate", "Diffuser Ring", "PCB Spacer" & "Lock Ring" are common parts that are shared across all sizes of the squircle enclosure family.

## How to 3D Print the Enclosures

Download the appropriate pre-built `.3mf` project file and open in your favorite slicer software:

Remove unnecssary plates, depending on your speaker selection, enclosure type, and whether your printer supports multi-material or multi-part printing.

!!! info "Recommend PETG-HF"

    We recommend PETG-HF with 30% infill for ideal for acoustics. PLA with 15% infill will work as well.

!!! info "No Supports Required"

    Study the screenshot above and you'll see how to print each part such that no supports are needed.

!!! info "Screws Are Required"

    M3 x 8mm screws are required for assembly. To maintain thread integrity, minimize repeated installation and removal of screws.

!!! warning "Sensors are not supported, yet"

    Enclosing a "Dev Kit" affects sensor accuracy—lux, temperature, and humidity readings won’t reflect the room, and the top plate is not designed to support mmWave sensors.  Our upcoming [power-over-ethernet SHOE board](satellite1-poe-shoe-module-overview.md) and an PoE mid-plate will relocate the sensors into the speaker chamber and add a PoE port to the enclosure.

!!! warning "When playing music at full volume the wake word may not respond"

    This is caused by vibrations traveling through the enclosure to the microphones. We're working with experts to address this in the official injection-molded enclosures. Stay tuned.

## Assemble the Enclosure

### Top Plate Assembly

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .lg .middle } Install Diffuser Ring

    ---

    ![Press in place](/assets/squircle-enclosure/IMG_6828-min.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    If you printed the diffuser ring as a separate part, apply light pressure around the ring to snap it in place. If you used our multi-material print, you can skip this step.

-   :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } Align the FPH Logos

    ---

    ![Line-Up Parts](/assets/squircle-enclosure/IMG_6748-min.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Find the two FPH logos on the top plate and lock ring. Line up the logos and the I/O ports.

-   :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } Snap Parts Together

    ---

    ![Snap Together](/assets/squircle-enclosure/IMG_6749-min.jpg){ loading=lazy }
    Sandwich the logos together and you'll feel both parts snap together.
