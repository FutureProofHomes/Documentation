## A Quick Note About Modular Hardware Design
Most customers think in terms of complete "products”.  So, at FutureProofHomes **we will sell complete pre-assembled products**.  However, unlike most hardware companies, our products will comprise of "modules", and each module is made up of "components”.  In simple terms, we like to think of FutureProofHomes as the “Ikea of hardware”.

Good modular hardware design allows us to quickly iterate our products and innovate faster than monolithic hardware companies.  It also allows our customers to easily repair and upgrade their products.  And finally it's also helps us assure our customers that we will avoid the pitfalls of [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) which many hardware companies fall into.  

In summary, a strong modular design strategy helps us keep a competitive advantage and adhere to our [core principals](https://futureproofhomes.net/pages/our-core-principles).
