## Modular Hardware Design

Most consumers think in terms of complete "products”.  So, at FutureProofHomes we will sell products.  However, our products are made of "modules".  And each module is made up of "components”. This means, when you purchase a FutureProofHomes product you will receive components and modules that you connect together to form the desired product.  Good modular hardware design allows us to quickly iterate our products and innovate faster than monolithic hardware companies, and it enables the customer to easily upgrade their products over time.

Example of Components:
