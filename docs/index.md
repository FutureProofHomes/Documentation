# Welcome

This is the product documentation site for [FutureProofHomes.net](https://futureproofhomes.net).  Here you will learn how to assemble, set up and configure our products for the optimal user experience.

This documentation is open source and we welcome your feedback or [contributions to the code](https://github.com/FutureProofHomes/Documentation).

## Why Modular Hardware Design

Most consumers think in terms of complete "products‚Äù -- and at FutureProofHomes we do sell products.  However, our products are made of modules.  And each module is made up of components. This means, when you purchase a FutureProofHomes product you will receive components and modules that you connect together to form the desired product.  Good modular hardware design allows us to quickly iterate our products and innovate faster than monolithic hardware companies, and it enables you to easily upgrade your products over time.  Pretty cool, huh?
