# Welcome

This is the product documentation site for [FutureProofHomes.net](https://futureproofhomes.net).  Here you will learn how to assemble, set up and configure our products for the optimal user experience.

This documentation is open source and we welcome your feedback or [contributions to the code](https://github.com/FutureProofHomes/Documentation?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing).

## What is Modular Hardware Design?

Most consumers think in terms of complete "products" â€” and at FutureProofHomes, we do sell products. However, our products are composed of modules, and each module is made up of components. This means that when you purchase a FutureProofHomes product, you will receive components and modules to connect and assemble into the desired product. Good modular hardware design allows us to iterate quickly and innovate faster than traditional hardware companies. It also enables you to easily upgrade your products over time. Pretty cool, right?
