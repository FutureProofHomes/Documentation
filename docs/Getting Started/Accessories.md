## Useful Accessories for your Satellite 1 dev board

## Speaker and connectors
The Satellite 1 comes with all kinds of options you might wish to enable.  One of the most useful is an external speaker.  There is a 2 pin JST 2.5mm female connector on the Hat board labeled SPKR OUT. Connect a speaker to this jack using these JST type connectors

For testing purposes, we've found that the plastic spray paint can tops are the perfect size to drop the speaker into!  It protects it and gives it much better bass response.
